# WLKR-76 Clone 👟 - Immersive Product Experience
An immersive, animation-driven web experience built from scratch with **React (TypeScript)**, **GSAP**, **Motion** (previously Framer Motion), and **Lenis**. This project showcases intricate scrolling interactions and animations to create beautiful, attractive, and engaging websites.

## 🌟 Features

 1. **Scroll-Controlled Video Playback**
    Experience video playback directly linked to scroll position – scroll down to play forward, scroll up to rewind, like scrubbing through a timeline. 🎥
 2. **Smooth Scrolling with Lenis**
    Enjoy fluid scrolling within a fixed container for a seamless experience. 🌀
 3. **Dynamic Header Elements**
    Header components that adapt and change based on the scroll position and the current section in view. 🔄
 4. **Staggered Scroll-Linked Word Animations**
    Watch characters animate in opposing directions as you scroll for a captivating text reveal effect. ✨
 5. **Scroll-Linked Image & Text Animations**
	   * Words animate character-by-character in opposing directions as you scroll, creating a striking visual effect.
    * Scroll-linked image reveals are paired with staggered character animations appearing in tracks below one another. 🔠
 6. **Pinned Product Details Carousel**
	* A product section remains pinned while scrolling through details. 
	* Carousel controls (buttons/dots) update product information, imagery, *and* jump the scroll position to relevant points within the pinned section. 
	* Scrolling naturally within the pinned distance also triggers these updates (debounced for performance).
		Engage with a rich, interactive product display. 👟📊 
7. **Pinned Image Animation Timeline**  
    Another pinned section where scroll progress reveals images and triggers staggered word animations sequentially. 🖼️⏳
    
8. **Horizontal Draggable Carousel**  
    Interact with a horizontally draggable carousel where:
    -   The image movement is linked to mouse intensity.  
    -   A friction-like effect slows the movement for a natural feel.
    -   Navigation dots can also trigger image transitions.
    Experience a modern, tactile navigation. 👉👈
